# numerical_analysis
Some work from a numerical analysis class taken some years ago (2016, I think). I'm making this public to showcase some of the work I've done previously and, hopefully, provide some help to those looking for it.

The work presented here is given as-is and remains in the same state as they were submitted. There are a couple of typos floating around, possibly one or two logic errors. If you're using this material as a study guide, be vigilant. I did my best when writing the documents to be precise as possible within the window of time I was allotted, but I'm only human.
